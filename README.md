This  project works on testnet and you can check the result.
Decentralized 2fa requires these 3 functions used in this code.
        
        createAccount
        
        
        createAsset
        
        
        transferAsset
        
        
If you register to our site, they must have an account or create new account.---createAccount.

And he/she must have an asset create an Asset to verify.---createAsset.

By using this he can transfer that to the server and verify.---transfer.

You can check these funcions from here.
So we can make 2fa easily with this boilerplate.  

*******************************
And this project include admin/user templete.
You can check the asset of all users and users can create/transfer their asset manually.
